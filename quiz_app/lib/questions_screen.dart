//* This sections contains common Doubts and Queries regarding this code
/* ///?111111111111111  `State<QuestionsScreen> createState()` is a rule for a Flutter widget named `QuestionsScreen`. This rule says: "When you need to remember changes (like user input or data from the internet), use the instructions I'll provide in `createState()` to keep track of those changes.
So, ///?`createState()` is like a memory box for the `QuestionsScreen` widget. It helps the widget remember things that can change over time. The actual instructions for what to remember and how to handle changes would be inside the `createState()` method, which is not shown in your selected code. */




/*//?2222222222222222 in very simple terms, `super.key` is like a special tag or label you can give to your `QuestionsScreen` when you create it. 
//?This `key` helps Flutter to identify that specific `QuestionsScreen` later on. It's like if you had a bunch of boxes and you put a unique label on one of them so you could find it easily later*/
